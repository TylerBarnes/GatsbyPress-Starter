It&#8217;s different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes).

I&#8217;m a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi\u00f1a coladas. (And gettin&#8217; caught in the rain.)</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&#8230;or something like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\r\n<p>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since.
